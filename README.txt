we implement an 8- puzzle game using three different algorithms BFS, DFS and Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm. 
The purpose of this project is to find the cheapest solution for the 8- puzzle game. The 8- puzzle 
game has an initial state and the goal state with digits from 0 to 8, where 0 represents the empty place.
The puzzle is a 3x3 board with 8 numbers, the goal state is ordering all the numbers on their correct position.

| type "make"  in order to create the executables.  And  then in the command line ./a.out

OOOOOOOORRRRRRRR 

Compile by g++ -std=c++11 -Wall -Wextra main.cpp Tile.cpp   and then in the command line ./a.out
